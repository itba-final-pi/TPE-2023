## Contributions

>[!IMPORTANT]
>All code changes must be made on a separate branch and later merged with approval from at least ONE other member.

Changes regarding documenation, typos, and other non-critical aspects may be commited directly to the main branch without approval or a pull request.

## Issues

All contributors are encouraged to open issues regarding questions, bugs and/or concerns.

Issues may be created to keep track, highlight or assign tasks to other members.
